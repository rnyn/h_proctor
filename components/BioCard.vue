            <h3>Revolutionary psychologies, communist neurologies, red therapies </h3>
            <p>
              I'm broadly interested in intersections between left-wing politics and
              psychology, histories and theories of radical psychiatry, and emotional
              histories of the Left.

          </p>

          <p>
            I'm currently a fellow affiliated with the ICI Berlin. I'm working on
            turning my PhD, completed at Birkbeck in 2016, into a monograph for the
            Palgrave Macmillan series 'Mental Health in Historical Perspective'.
            <i>Psychologies in Revolution: Alexander Luria, Soviet Subjectivites and Cultural
            History</i> situates the innovative cross-disciplinary clinical research of Soviet psychologist
            and neurologist Alexander Luria (1902-1977) in its politicised historical
            context. Eschewing a biographical approach focused on Luria as an
            individual, the book instead seeks to foreground the often marginalised
            Soviet people – industrial workers, imprisoned murderers, rural school
            children, deaf babies, homeless teenagers, Uzbek women and brain-injured
            former soldiers – with whom his clinical work brought him into contact. I'm
            also working on a book project for Verso on psychic aftermath of political
            struggle. I've amassed a pile of material on femininity and hardness – with
            the working title 'Stone Femme' – to which I hope to return at some point
            as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've written for both academic and non-academic publications on topics
            including rayon stockings, gender and the death drive, utopian pedagogy,
            Communist motherhood, wrinkles, the aesthetics of fMRI, Soviet babies,
            revolutionary commemoration, British antipsychiatry, mourning, Carl Jung's
            influence on Jordan Peterson, and Ulrike Meinhof’s brain. I'd like to write
            more about film. I'm on the editorial collective of <i>Radical Philosophy</i>.
