            <h3>Revolutionary psychologies, communist neurologies, red therapies </h3>
            <p>
            I'm broadly interested in intersections between left-wing politics and
            psychology, histories and theories of radical psychiatry, and emotional
            histories of the Left.
          </p>

            I'm a fellow affiliated with the ICI Berlin and teach at Bard College,
            Berlin. I'm currently working on turning my PhD, completed at Birkbeck in
            2016, into a monograph for the Palgrave Macmillan series 'Mental Health in
            Historical Perspective'. <i>Psychologies in Revolution: Alexander Luria,
            Soviet Subjectivites and Cultural History</i> situates the innovative
            cross-disciplinary clinical research of Soviet psychologist and neurologist
            Alexander Luria (1902-1977) in its politicised historical
            context. Eschewing a biographical approach focused on Luria as an
            individual, the book instead seeks to foreground the often marginalised
            Soviet people - industrial workers, imprisoned murderers, rural school
            children, deaf babies, kolkhoz members, homeless teenagers, Uzbek women,
            orphaned teenagers, and brain-injured former soldiers - with whom his
            clinical work brought him into contact. Luria recognised the primacy of
            history for understanding human consciousness and his ideas about
            subjectivity, cognition and mental health have a hitherto overlooked
            history of their own. I've amassed a pile of material on femininity and
            hardness - with the working title 'Stone Femme' - to which I'd like to
            return to and keep meaning to write something about the film <i>Johnny
            Mnemonic</i>. I'm also working on a book project focused on 'burnout' and the
            psychic aftermaths of radical political struggles.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've written for both academic and non-academic publications on
            topics including rayon stockings, gender and the death drive, utopian
            pedagogy, Communist motherhood, wrinkles, the aesthetics of fMRI, Soviet
            babies, revolutionary commemoration, British antipsychiatry, mourning, Carl
            Jung's influence on Jordan Peterson, and Ulrike Meinhofâ€™s brain. I'm on the
            editorial collective of <i>Radical Philosophy</i>.
