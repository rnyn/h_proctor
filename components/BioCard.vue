            <h4>Revolutionary psychologies, communist neurologies, red therapies </h4>

              I'm broadly interested in intersections between left-wing politics and
              psychology, histories and theories of radical psychiatry, and emotional
              histories of the Left.

            I'm a Wellcome Trust Research Fellow at the University of Strathclyde
working on British and American Cold War era social science projects that
investigated the Soviet mind. I was previously a fellow at the ICI Berlin
and completed my PhD at Birkbeck, University of London. Before that I
worked in theatre. My monograph <i>Psychologies in Revolution: Alexander
Luria, Soviet Subjectivites and Cultural History</i> was published as part
of the Palgrave Macmillan series 'Mental Health in Historical Perspective'. <i>Psychologies
in Revolution</i> situates the cross-disciplinary clinical research of
Soviet psychologist and neurologist Alexander Luria (1902-1977) in its
politicised historical context. Eschewing a biographical approach focused
on Luria as an individual, the book instead seeks to foreground the often
marginalised Soviet people – industrial workers, imprisoned murderers,
rural school children, deaf babies, homeless teenagers, Uzbek women and
brain-injured former soldiers – with whom his clinical work brought him
into contact. I'm also working on a book project for Verso on political
defeat and the psychic aftermath of political struggle.

            I've written for both academic and non-academic publications on topics
            including rayon stockings, gender and the death drive, utopian pedagogy,
            Communist motherhood, wrinkles, the aesthetics of fMRI, Soviet babies,
            revolutionary commemoration, British antipsychiatry, mourning, Carl Jung's
            influence on Jordan Peterson, and Ulrike Meinhof’s brain. I'd like to write
            more about film. I'm on the editorial collective of <i>Radical Philosophy</i>.
